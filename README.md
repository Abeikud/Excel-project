## üîç Project Overview
This Excel-based data analysis project focuses on customer churn using the **Telco Customer Churn dataset**. The goal was to explore which factors contribute to customer churn and visualize patterns that can inform business decisions.

Key areas of analysis include:
- Churn rate by contract type
- Payment method vs churn behavior

##Datasets Used
-<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn/data">Telco Data set</a>
-<a href="https://github.com/Abeikud/Excel-project/blob/main/My%20Customer%20Churn%20Analysis.xlsx">Excel files


## Excel Features Used
- Data Cleaning (removing blanks, standardizing values, converting data types)
- `IF`, `COUNTIF`
- Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts
- Conditional Formatting
- Slicers and Filters
- Bar  Charts

##  Key Visuals & Insights

###  Churn Rate by Contract Type
- Month-to-month customers showed the **highest churn rate**.
- Two-year contract customers had the lowest churn**, suggesting longer commitments improve retention.

###  Churn by Payment Method
- Customers using **Electronic Check** had significantly **higher churn rates**.
- Those using **Credit Card (automatic)** or **Bank Transfer (automatic)** were **less likely to churn**.



## What I Learned
- Cleaning and preparing data in Excel for analysis
- Using pivot tables to break down categorical variables
- Drawing actionable insights from visual trends


##  Future Improvements
- Use Power BI or Tableau for interactive dashboards
- Integrate Python or SQL for deeper statistical modeling
